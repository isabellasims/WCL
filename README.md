## Readme.md format:

Provide a status update in the readme.md of your project repo that is no more than 250-500 words and includes the following items. This update should be uploaded to your final project repo (do not submit anything to blackboard):

images of the current interface (rough prototype is fine, but it should be clear you have been able to load part of your data into a static visualization at least). These do not need to be beautiful, just show the progress you've made in getting to a working interface.

any modifications to your proposed implementation approach. What libraries have you been using? Has your implementation approach changed significantly? If so, why?
milestones and schedule. How is your project tracking against your milestones? Are you on schedule? If not, what's blocking you from making progress?

your code pushed to the repo, with a public-facing link to the interface
If you did not receive full credit for your design document, particularly the project realization, this is an opportunity to show that you have responded to that feedback.
